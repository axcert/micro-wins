  - Use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for dynamic content
  - Optimize images with next/image component
  - Implement proper caching strategies

- **Python Performance:**
  - Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
  - Implement database connection pooling
  - Consider caching frequently accessed data
  - Optimize database queries with proper indexing

#### Security Enhancements
