# Codebase Documentation

This document provides an overview of the project's architecture, structure, and key components.

## Project Overview

- **Total Files:** 1
- **Project Size:** small
- **Main Languages:** 

## Directory Structure

```
project-root/

```

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a unknown architecture pattern suitable for frontend_spa applications.

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between business logic, data access, and presentation layers
2. **Modularity**: Components are organized in self-contained modules
3. **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling
4. **Maintainability**: Code is organized for easy maintenance and updates

## Key Components

Key components are organized according to feature and functionality.

## File Organization

### File Type Distribution

- `.md` files: 1


## Code Standards

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-service.js`)
- **Components**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `getUserData`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **CSS Classes**: Use kebab-case for CSS classes (e.g., `user-profile-card`)

### Code Style

Follow the established code style patterns found in existing code.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are managed using standard package management tools.

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables and configuration files.

## Development Patterns

The project follows established development patterns for the technology stack.

## API Structure

API endpoints follow RESTful design principles.

## Database Schema

Database configuration follows standard patterns for the technology stack.

## Security Considerations

- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Authentication required for protected routes
- CORS configuration for API access

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading for large components
- Caching strategies implemented
- Database query optimization
- Asset bundling and minification

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Expand test coverage
