## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Development Environment
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test                    # For JavaScript/TypeScript
pytest                     # For Python
mvn test                   # For Java

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage      # JavaScript/TypeScript
pytest --cov=src          # Python
mvn test jacoco:report     # Java

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests only
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Health checks
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics

# Load testing
k6 run load-test.js
artillery run artillery-config.yml

# Security scanning
npm audit
docker scan image-name
```

## 📝 Test Case Templates

### Unit Test Template
```javascript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render without crashing', () => {
    // Arrange
    const props = { /* test props */ };
    
    // Act
    const component = render(<ComponentName {...props} />);
    
    // Assert
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Integration Test Template
```javascript
describe('API Integration', () => {
  it('should handle API requests correctly', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const testData = { /* test data */ };
    
    // Act
    const response = await apiCall(testData);
    
    // Assert
    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.data).toMatchObject(expectedData);
  });
});
```

## 🎯 Test Automation Strategy

### Continuous Integration
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Run linting and basic tests
- **Pull Request Validation:** Full test suite execution
- **Merge Validation:** Integration and E2E tests
- **Deployment Validation:** Production smoke tests

### Test Data Management
- **Test Database:** Separate database for testing
- **Data Fixtures:** Reusable test data sets
- **Data Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup after tests
- **Mock Services:** External service mocking
